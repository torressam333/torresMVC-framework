Blueprint MVC framework
//Remember, if you use as a blueprint, to change the directory/project name to your own name.
//This can be changed in the .htaccess file within the public directory.
//Change this line (line #4) -> "RewriteBase /torresMVC/public" -> change torresMVC to your own project name.
